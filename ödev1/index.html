    <h1 id="Topic3"> Turkish War of Independence</h1>
    <p>he Turkish War of Independence[note 3] (19 May 1919 – 24 July 1923) was a series of military campaigns waged by
        the Turkish National Movement after parts of the Ottoman Empire were occupied and partitioned following its
        defeat in World War I. These campaigns were directed against Greece in the west, Armenia in the east, France in
        the south, loyalists and separatists in various cities, and British and Ottoman troops around Constantinople
        (İstanbul).[59]

        vte
        Revolutions of
        1917–1923
        The ethnic demographics of the modern Turkish Republic were significantly impacted by the earlier Armenian
        genocide and the deportations of Greek-speaking, Orthodox Christian Rum people.[60] The Turkish nationalist
        movement carried out massacres and deportations to eliminate native Christian populations—a continuation of the
        Armenian genocide and other ethnic cleansing operations during World War I.[61] Following these campaigns of
        ethnic cleansing the historic Christian presence in Anatolia was destroyed, in large part, and the Muslim
        demographic had increased from 80% to 98%.[60]

        While World War I ended for the Ottoman Empire with the Armistice of Mudros, the Allied Powers continued
        occupying and seizing land for imperialist designs, as well as to prosecute former members of the Committee of
        Union and Progress and those involved in the Armenian genocide.[62][63] Ottoman military commanders therefore
        refused orders from both the Allies and the Ottoman government to surrender and disband their forces. This
        crisis reached a head when sultan Mehmed VI dispatched Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Atatürk), a well-respected and
        high-ranking general, to Anatolia to restore order; however, Mustafa Kemal became an enabler and eventually
        leader of Turkish nationalist resistance against the Ottoman government, Allied powers, and Christian
        minorities.

        In an attempt to establish control over the power vacuum in Anatolia, the Allies persuaded Greek Prime Minister
        Eleftherios Venizelos to launch an expeditionary force into Anatolia and occupy Smyrna (İzmir), beginning the
        Turkish War of Independence. A nationalist counter government led by Mustafa Kemal was established in Ankara
        when it became clear the Ottoman government was backing the Allied powers. The Allies soon pressured the Ottoman
        government in Constantinople into suspending the Constitution, shuttering the Parliament, and signing the Treaty
        of Sèvres, a treaty unfavorable to Turkish interests that the "Ankara government" declared illegal.

        In the ensuing war, irregular militia defeated the French forces in the south, and undemobilized units went on
        to partition Armenia with Bolshevik forces, resulting in the Treaty of Kars (October 1921). The Western Front of
        the independence war was known as the Greco-Turkish War, in which Greek forces at first encountered unorganized
        resistance. However İsmet Pasha's organization of militia into a regular army paid off when Ankara forces fought
        the Greeks in the Battles of First and Second İnönü. The Greek army emerged victorious in the Battle of
        Kütahya-Eskişehir and decided to drive on the nationalist capital of Ankara, stretching their supply lines. The
        Turks checked their advance in the Battle of Sakarya and counter-attacked in the Great Offensive, which expelled
        Greek forces from Anatolia in the span of three weeks. The war effectively ended with the recapture of İzmir and
        the Chanak Crisis, prompting the signing of another armistice in Mudanya.

        The Grand National Assembly in Ankara was recognized as the legitimate Turkish government, which signed the
        Treaty of Lausanne (July 1923), a treaty more favorable to Turkey than the Sèvres Treaty. The Allies evacuated
        Anatolia and Eastern Thrace, the Ottoman government was overthrown and the monarchy abolished, and the Grand
        National Assembly of Turkey (which remains Turkey's primary legislative body today) declared the Republic of
        Turkey on 29 October 1923. With the war, a population exchange between Greece and Turkey,[64] the partitioning
        of the Ottoman Empire, and the abolition of the sultanate, the Ottoman era came to an end, and with Atatürk's
        reforms, the Turks created the modern, secular nation-state of Turkey. On 3 March 1924, the Ottoman caliphate
        was also abolished.

        Prelude: October 1918 – May 1919
        Conclusion of World War I

        Front page of İkdam on 4 November 1918, after the Three Pashas fled the Ottoman Empire following World War I
        See also: Committee of Union and Progress and Ottoman Empire in World War I
        In the summer months of 1918, the leaders of the Central Powers realized that World War I was lost, including
        the Ottomans'. Almost simultaneously the Palestinian Front and then the Macedonian Front collapsed. The sudden
        decision by Bulgaria to sign an armistice cut communications from Constantinople (İstanbul) to Vienna and
        Berlin, and opened the undefended Ottoman capital to Entente attack. With the major fronts crumbling, Grand
        Vizier Talât Pasha intended to sign an armistice, and resigned on 8 October 1918 so that a new government would
        receive less harsh armistice terms. The Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918, ending World War I
        for the Ottoman Empire.[65] Three days later, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP)—which governed the
        Ottoman Empire as a one-party state since 1913—held its last congress, where it was decided the party would be
        dissolved. Talât, Enver Pasha, Cemal Pasha, and five other high-ranking members of the CUP escaped the Ottoman
        Empire on a German torpedo boat later that night, plunging the country into a power vacuum.

        The armistice was signed because the Ottoman Empire had been defeated in important fronts, but the military was
        intact and retreated in good order. Unlike other Central Powers, the Allies did not mandate the Ottoman Army to
        dissolve its general staff. Though the army suffered from mass desertion through out the war which lead to
        banditry, there was no threat of mutiny or revolutions like in Germany, Austria-Hungary, or Russia. Due to the
        Turkish nationalist policies pursued by the CUP against Ottoman Christians and the dismemberment of the Arab
        provinces, by 1918 the Ottoman Empire held control over a mostly homogeneous land of Muslim Turks (and Kurds)
        from Eastern Thrace to the Persian border, though with sizable Greek and Armenian minorities still within its
        borders.[66]

        Armistice of Mudros and prelude to resistance
        On 30 October 1918, the Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies of World War I,
        bringing hostilities in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I to an end. The Ottoman Army was to demobilize,
        its navy and air force handed to the Allies, and occupied territory in the Caucasus and Persia to be evacuated.
        Article VII granted the Allies the right to occupy forts controlling the Turkish Straits (to assist the White
        Russians in their struggle against the Bolsheviks); and the vague right to occupy "in case of disorder" any
        territory if there were a threat to security, this was to follow through the charges of crimes against humanity
        orchestrated by the CUP government against Armenian Ottomans.[67][68] For now, the House of Osman escaped the
        fates of the Hohenzollerns, Habsburgs, and Romanovs to continue ruling their empire, though at the cost of its
        remaining sovereignty.


        Mustafa Kemal Pasha in 1918, then an Ottoman army general
        On 13 November 1918, a French brigade entered Constantinople to begin a de facto occupation of the Ottoman
        capital and its immediate dependencies. This was followed by a fleet consisting of British, French, Italian and
        Greek ships deploying soldiers on the ground the next day, totaling 50,000 troops in Constantinople.[69] The
        Allied Powers stated that the occupation was temporary and its purpose was to protect the monarchy, the
        Caliphate and the minorities. Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe—the British signatory of the Mudros
        Armistice—stated the Triple Entente's public position that they had no intention to dismantle the Ottoman
        government or place it under military occupation by "occupying Constantinople".[70] However, dismantling the
        government and partitioning the Ottoman Empire among the Allied nations had been an objective of the Entente
        since the start of WWI.[71]

        Greek and Armenian refugees were also to be sent back to their homes that they were forced from under the CUP,
        but most found their old homes inhabited by equally desperate Rumelian Muslim refugees from the Balkan Wars
        settled in their properties during the First World War. Ethnic conflict restarted in Ottoman land, especially in
        the Black Sea, Aegean, Eastern Anatolian and Central Anatolian regions; government officials responsible for
        resettling Christian refugees often assisted Muslim refugees in these disputes, prompting European powers to
        continue bringing Ottoman territory under their control.[72]

        A wave of seizures took place in the rest of the country in the following months. Citing Article VII, British
        forces demanded that Turkish troops evacuate Mosul, claiming that Christian civilians in Mosul and Zakho were
        killed en masse.[73] On 14 November, joint Franco-Greek troops occupied the town of Uzunköprü in Eastern Thrace
        as well as the railway axis until the train station of Hadımköy on the outskirts of Constantinople. On 1
        December, British troops based in Syria occupied Kilis, Maraş, Urfa and Birecik. Beginning in December, French
        troops began successive seizures of Ottoman territory in Cilicia, including the towns of Antakya, Mersin,
        Tarsus, Ceyhan, Adana, Osmaniye, and İslâhiye[74] while French forces embarked by gunboats and sent troops to
        the Black Sea ports of Zonguldak and Karadeniz Ereğli commanding Turkey's coal mining region. These continued
        seizures of land prompted Ottoman commanders to refuse demobilization and prepare for renewed conflict.

        The British similarly asked Mustafa Kemal Pasha to turn over the port of Alexandretta (İskenderun), which he
        reluctantly did, following which he was recalled to Constantinople. He made sure to distribute weapons to the
        population to prevent them from falling into the hands of Allied forces. Some of these weapons were smuggled to
        the east by members of Karakol, a successor to the Special Organization, to be used in case resistance was
        necessary in Anatolia. Many Ottoman officials participated in efforts to conceal from the occupying authorities
        details of the burgeoning independence movement spreading throughout Anatolia.[75]

        Other commanders began refusing orders from the Ottoman government and the Allied powers. After Mustafa Kemal
        Pasha returned to Constantinople, Ali Fuat Pasha (Cebesoy) brought XX Corps under his command.[76] He marched
        first to Konya and then to Ankara to organise resistance groups, such as the Circassian çetes he assembled with
        guerilla leader Çerkes Ethem. Meanwhile, Kazım Karabekir Pasha refused to surrender his intact and powerful XV
        Corps in Erzurum.[77]</p>

    <h1 id="Topic1">18th March Çanakkale Victory and Martyrs' Day</h1>
    <p>18th March Çanakkale Victory and Martyrs' Day is a national day of remembrance in Turkey. 18 March is known in
        Turkey as Canakkale Victory and Martyr’s Day. It’s an important day, and this year of Turkey’s defeat of Allied
        battleships who tried to take control of the Dardanelles, shelling Turkish forts along both the Asian and
        European shores of the Dardanelles in Çanakkale. During this attack, the town of Çanakkale, particularly its
        Greek quarter suffered extensive damage. This day was a critical turning point in the nation building process of
        Turkey and every year we stop to remember the incredible courage and commitment of those soldiers who fought for
        Turkey’s freedom.</p>

    <h1 id="Topic2">Personal life of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</h1>
    <p>Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (Turkish pronunciation: [mustafa kemal atatyɾk]) (1881 – 10 November 1938) founded the
        Republic of Turkey, and served as its president from 1923 until his death on 10 November 1938. His personal life
        has been the subject of numerous studies. According to Turkish historian Kemal H. Karpat, Atatürk's recent
        bibliography included 7,010 different sources.[1] Atatürk's personal life has its controversies, ranging from
        where he was born to his correct full name. The details of his marriage have always been a subject of debate.
        His religious beliefs were discussed in Turkish political life as recently as the Republic Protests during the
        2007 presidential election.

        Mustafa Kemal's personality has been an important subject both for scholars and the general public.[1] Much of
        substantial personal information about him comes from memoirs by his associates, who were at times his rivals,
        and friends. Some credible information originates from Ali Fuat Cebesoy, Kâzım Karabekir, Halide Edib Adıvar,
        Kılıç Ali, Falih Rıfkı Atay, Afet İnan, there is also secondary analysis by Patrick Balfour, the 3rd Baron
